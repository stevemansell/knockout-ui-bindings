knockout-ui-bindings
====================

Re-usable UI widgets in the form of custom bindings for use with knockoutJS.

These components were created for use on the [v-Learning Portal](http://www.v-learningsolutions.com) our [industry-leading virtual learning software-as-a-service product](http://www.v-learningsolutions.com).

Notes:

- Apologies for the state of this repo, there just isn't time enough in the day to make it tidy!
- Generally these widgets have a dependency on JQuery, although JQLite will probably work too.
